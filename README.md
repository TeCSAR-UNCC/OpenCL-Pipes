# OpenCL-Pipes
Implementing OpenCL Pipes for Rodinia applications on Xilinx FPGAs

![Tecsar](/tecsar_logo.png)

This fork contains 2 parts.

1. OpenCL codes of a subset of Rodinia benchmark suite, version 3.1 ported and deployed on the AWS EC2 Cloud Xilinx VU9P FPGA. For the original benchmark page along with datasets and libs, refer [here](http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/Rodinia/download_links.htm).

2. Optimised version of the above codes(kernel, host and makefile) using OpenCL Pipes run on the same FPGA platform.
